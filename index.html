            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When University President Lee Bollinger, Law ’71, inherited the presidency in 2002, the turn of the 21st century gave rise to a pivotal time for Columbia. Unthinkable tragedy had struck New York City and the nation on Sept. 11, 2001—the day Bollinger planned to meet with the presidential search committee in Midtown.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Bollinger “walked with ghostly figures, covered in ash, streaming up the middle of the streets from lower Manhattan,” he described in his remarks at an April presidential celebration event. The devastation stayed with him for years as he embarked on a bold and challenging tenure.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  He knew Columbia needed drastic, fundamental changes. After a period of urban decay in New York City through the 1970s, the ’80s had decimated Columbia’s endowment, and the end of the century was spent attempting to recover from bankruptcy. The University became severely “decentralized,” and it was in desperate need of modernization.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  There was one primary problem Bollinger identified right away: space. Columbia’s location in New York City both blessed, and plagued, its ability to grow as an intellectual epicenter.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The 19th University president would go on to propose the major and ambitious expansion project of the Manhattanville campus, a state-of-the-art campus meant to be built out over the next 100 to 150 years. But Bollinger also had to revive alumni connections, fundraising bases, and a sense of institutional unity.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As Bollinger prepares to <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/04/14/after-two-decades-as-president-bollinger-to-step-down-in-2023/">depart</a> the presidency on June 30 after over two decades in the role, he imparted his reflections and last words to Columbia in multiple interviews with Spectator over the course of his final year as president.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “In a phrase, it has been a dream,” Bollinger said at his presidential celebration, a speech he pointed Spectator to as representative of his views on the presidency. “For me, this has not been a job or an interesting position. It has been the fulfillment of a dream that was undreamt.”

  As soon as Bollinger took the helm, he hit the ground running. He announced the hallmark of his presidential era, the Manhattanville campus, just a year into the job in 2003. The vision for what would become a $6.3 billion and 17-acre development spanning 125th Street to 134th Street began taking shape.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  But the project spurred immense pushback from students and West Harlem leaders, who criticized Columbia’s long history of encroachment on its neighboring communities. In 2008, the Empire State Development Corporation agreed to adopt Columbia’s plan for the educational mixed-use area and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/nyregion/18columbia.html">declared</a> the planned site as “blighted,”  or otherwise deteriorated, abandoned, or hazardous.

  Columbia <a href="https://neighbors.columbia.edu/news/university-statement-empire-state-development-corporations-adoption-general-project-plan">requested</a> the ESDC exercise eminent domain—a legal process by which the government can seize private land for a public purpose—on the commercial development in the area, but in a <a href="https://neighbors.columbia.edu/news/university-statement-empire-state-development-corporations-adoption-general-project-plan">press release</a> said it would not do so over occupied residential properties.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “This is an extremely important moment in the history of Columbia,” Bollinger told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/nyregion/25columbia.html">New York Times</a> at the time of the decision. “It’s only fair to say that the opportunity to build a new campus comes along very rarely.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The <a href="https://gca.columbia.edu/content/community-benefits-agreement">Community Benefits Agreement</a>, signed by Bollinger and the West Harlem Local Development Corporation in 2009, laid out Columbia’s $150 million promise to fund affordable housing, education, and more in the area as a way to alleviate mounting concerns. Over the years, however, West Harlem residents have accused Columbia of <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/city-news/2022/04/11/cba-educational-benefits-scarcely-known-within-west-harlem-community-members-say/">under-fulfilling</a> those commitments—and a sense of resentment for the new campus has yet to go away.

  “If we’re interested in trying to understand the world, what better place to do it from as here,” Bollinger told Spectator in November. “That means we’re going to have to expand in the neighborhood, and we’re going to have to work with neighbors to do that. People thought that was crazy.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The perception of the plan as “crazy” partially came from what Bollinger characterized as Columbia’s “identity problem,” in which it previously did not “want to think of itself as part of Harlem.” He recalled people telling him he would never get the surrounding communities to agree to the Manhattanville campus either.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Despite it all, Bollinger went big, and to do so, he spent years figuring out ways to engage with the neighborhood.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I believe that the way in which Columbia interacted with the community was very principled, very caring, and generous,” Bollinger said. “I feel very good about it.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  A glimpse of Bollinger’s Manhattanville dream came to fruition when the first two buildings, the Jerome L. Greene Science Center and the Lenfest Center for the Arts, opened their doors in 2017. He hit another major milestone when Columbia Business School <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/01/31/business-school-officially-moves-to-manhattanville-campus/">officially moved</a> out of Uris Hall and into a new construction on the Manhattanville campus in January 2022, funded by a <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/10/20/business-school-receives-75-million-donation-from-entertainment-mogul-prepares-to-move-to-manhattanville-in-january/">$75 million gift</a> from entertainment mogul David Geffen.

</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Now, two buildings remain in progress before the completion of the project’s first of three phases. What is currently at Manhattanville is only a third of the entire project, Bollinger said, and the designation of how certain buildings will be used is still to be determined.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Bollinger has designated a site to the School of Engineering and Applied Science and another site—to which the School of International and Public Affairs <a href="https://morningsidepost.com/articles/2022/10/13/qa-dean-keren-yarhi-milo">originally had interest</a> in moving—to the Climate School.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Passing the baton of Manhattanville to Shafik comes with important decisions on space allocation in the Morningside Heights campus, too. A 2021 <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/08/27/in-the-wake-of-pandemic-losses-administration-explores-undergraduate-expansion/">inquiry</a> into potentially increasing the number of undergraduate students in Columbia College and SEAS called into question the state of the student experience.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The inquiry’s Core and Student Life Expansion Working Group—chaired by former Columbia College Dean James Valentini—found that Columbia’s lack of space has strained dining halls, the Core Curriculum, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/09/26/the-classroom-problem-frustrations-over-registration-reach-a-fever-pitch/">course registration</a> and waitlists, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/10/07/university-senate-report-raises-alarm-over-critical-lack-of-performance-practice-space-on-campus/">performance spaces</a>, and housing. A post-pandemic “enrollment bubble,” which caused an increase of 800 undergraduate students compared to pre-pandemic numbers, only intensified these issues.

The Business School’s move to Manhattanville freed up much of the building, which Bollinger dedicated to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the budgetary unit that includes Columbia College and General Studies.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In April, Columbia College Dean Josef Sorett invited undergraduate student leaders to the building for a focus group to “discuss renovation plans and provide … input on design opportunities for open common spaces, dining options, and the library.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We’re dealing with a deficit of good space, and it will take time,” Bollinger told Spectator in May. “But Uris is a very important effort.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Jonathan Lavine, chair of Columbia’s board of trustees and the building’s new namesake, gifted a multimillion dollar donation to transform Uris with more classroom, department, research, and student space. As much as it is a long-awaited solution, once parts of the building begin to go offline for renovation, there is the potential for an exacerbated—albeit temporary—bottlenecking of students.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “These things take quite a bit of time, but they absolutely need to happen,” Bollinger said. “I’ve taught in the same classroom in Schermerhorn for 21 years. It’s not a great classroom, and so I’m well aware of the problems.”

In his public addresses, Valentini often described Columbia College as “the greatest college in the greatest University in the greatest city in the world.” Bollinger wrote that the dean was a “successful and beloved institutional leader” in an email sent to the Columbia community on Sept. 23, 2021 announcing Valentini’s departure.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In September 2021, Bollinger formed The Task Force on the Relationship of the Arts and Sciences and the College, which set out to explore a reorganization of power to centralize FAS, increase student and alumni identification with FAS, and prompt the Columbia College dean to share more authority with the executive vice president of Arts and Sciences over certain affairs, among other goals.
</p>

  Many of the tensions that have historically arisen between FAS and the college are born out of differences in fundraising prowess. While Columbia College is a consistent <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/10/27/giving-day-hits-nearly-30-million-in-donations-for-first-time-in-11-year-history/">top performer</a> for donations, with a strong alumni base, the Arts and Sciences as a whole, responsible for the gargantuan commitment of Columbia College need-blind financial aid, is perennially cash-strapped.

  “It’s an area that has deep passions [and] a lot of misperceptions,” Bollinger told Spectator in April 2022. “It has a tendency to erupt in fears and criticisms, even though they’re not warranted.”

  Bollinger has made his stance on the matter clear. He sees restructuring as an “elevation of the role of the faculty” and “not a diminution of the role of the dean of the college.” Last May, Arts and Sciences faculty ultimately <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/05/25/after-months-of-contention-arts-and-sciences-faculty-endorse-restructuring-proposals/">endorsed</a> the three proposals.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Throughout much of the scandal, Bollinger had yet to make a public comment. University Provost Mary Boyce, whose office oversaw the collection of the data before she was provost, steered most of the University’s response. It wasn’t until Bollinger <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/12/07/a-significant-mistake-bollinger-breaks-silence-on-us-news-scandal/">broke his silence</a> on the topic in a November interview with Spectator that Columbia heard from the president on the U.S. News ranking.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I internalize everything about Columbia. It’s just the nature of me and this institution,” Bollinger said. “I feel terrible about this mistake.

  These doubts soon spread beyond undergraduate rankings. In November, Columbia Law School <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/11/18/columbia-law-school-drops-out-of-us-news-ranking-following-peer-institutions/">joined a movement</a> to opt out of the law school rankings, following Harvard Law School and Yale Law School.

  Navigating the role of rankings, and overall institutional reputation, is one of many unique challenges Shafik will undertake. Under Bollinger’s leadership, Columbia’s endowment more than tripled in value from $4.3 billion to $13.3 billion, reaching a height of $14.35 billion in fiscal year 2021. The endowment “professionalized” during his tenure, Bollinger said, with the <a href="https://www.finance.columbia.edu/content/columbia-investment-management-company">Columbia Investment Management Company</a>, which is responsible for overseeing the University’s managed assets.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Despite the impressive growth over Bollinger’s presidency, the endowment most recently posted a <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/10/13/endowment-suffers-more-than-1b-in-losses-as-columbia-reports-negative-returns/">decline of 7.6 percent</a> in fiscal year 2022, the worst performance in the Ivy League. The drop came after a post-pandemic-fueled <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/10/27/columbia-endowment-soars-up-323-percent-to-1435-billion-as-markets-recover-from-covid-19-recession/">growth</a> of 32.3 percent in fiscal year 2021, but followed patterns of Columbia’s endowment lagging behind its peers.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Shafik’s experience in academic administration comes from her  role as director of the London School of Economics. While LSE <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/01/18/how-does-the-london-school-of-economics-compare-to-columbia/">shares some characteristics</a> with Columbia, namely its urban location and selectivity, the schools are distinct in many ways. LSE’s student population is less than one-third the size of Columbia’s and consists of primarily postgraduate students. Its endowment is around 300 million dollars, almost 45 times smaller than Columbia’s.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  However, with her <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/01/18/meet-shafik-columbias-next-university-president/">rich background</a> in economics, both academically and professionally, Shafik is intimately familiar with the complexities of a large budget. At the Bank of England, where she was deputy governor for three years, she oversaw a balance of the equivalent of $605 billion.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">

  Over the course of two decades, Bollinger brought in over $13 billion in donations. The Columbia Campaign, which began in 2005 and spanned nine years, raised funds for financial aid, endowed professorships, the Manhattanville campus, Morningside renovations, and more.

  The Columbia Commitment, in particular, leveraged a new, global vision for Columbia that went beyond the University’s gates.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Much of the funds raised from the campaign went towards advancing Bollinger’s vision of the “Fourth Purpose.” In addition to research, education, and service, Bollinger believes that Columbia must promote the “advancement of human welfare” by engaging the University’s research capacities with missions beyond its educational and research prerogatives. In September 2019, Bollinger started a Fourth Purpose taskforce, which produced a report made public in February 2021 recommending a variety of ways in which the Fourth Purpose mission could be facilitated.

  During his tenure, Columbia has established 11 Global Centers in Amman, Athens, Beijing, Istanbul, Mumbai, Nairobi, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, Tunis, and, most recently, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/04/04/columbia-global-announces-tel-aviv-center/">Tel Aviv</a>.

  Another manifestation of the Fourth Purpose came in 2020, when the University established its first new school in 25 years. The Climate School, which <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/05/17/climate-school-marks-inaugural-class-day/">graduated</a> its inaugural class in May 2022, was <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2020/02/06/donors-havent-given-to-columbias-climate-research-columbia-says-the-climate-school-will-change-that/">created</a> to facilitate interdisciplinary scholarship and education on climate change.

  “Her own background and her own professional experiences lead her to have knowledge and a disposition that just fits perfectly with Columbia’s global international policy,” Bollinger said.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The Global Centers have not come without backlash, however. The announcement of the Tel Aviv center came after <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/04/04/columbia-global-announces-tel-aviv-center/">faculty published an open letter</a> to Bollinger condemning the decision to open the center, given Israel’s current political state.

  Both Bollinger’s decision to invite the Iranian president and his hostile introduction sparked debate amongst faculty and students on campus, even drawing national attention. Bollinger said the event was one of the most memorable moments of his presidency: He “loved” the numerous “debates” and “intensity on the campus at that time.”

  “I’m pretty clear in my own mind about how a system should work with very vigorous protests, and I really stuck to this throughout my whole term and my whole life,” Bollinger said.

  “The [protests] that we have today are the ones we have today,” Bollinger said. “We’ve had ones every single year since I’ve been president, and every year before that, and there will be every year from here on.”

  Bollinger said at his presidential celebration that there were two times New York City fell silent: 9/11 and the pandemic. At the peak of COVID-19, Columbia lost roughly $100 million a month, and students abruptly shifted to virtual learning. Even with an in-person return in fall 2021, lasting restrictions impeded Columbia’s normalcy.

  The police killing of George Floyd in 2020 further rocked the nation and the University, pushing America’s institutions to grapple with systemic racism within their own walls. Bollinger was quick to reaffirm Columbia’s <a href="https://president.columbia.edu/news/columbias-commitment-antiracism">commitment to anti-racism</a>, promising to accelerate the University’s $185 million pledge to increasing <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/03/10/the-leaky-pipeline-as-faculty-advance-diversity-diminishes/">faculty diversity</a>, strengthen the <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/02/10/columbia-university-and-slavery-project-launches-historical-campus-markers/">Columbia University and Slavery Project</a>, and establish an <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/02/22/inclusive-public-safety-advisory-committee-starts-to-make-headway-amid-administrative-turnover/">Inclusive Public Safety</a> working group, among other initiatives.

  Recently, Bollinger formed the <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/02/17/presidents-commission-on-the-history-of-race-and-racism-to-shed-light-on-columbias-past-and-present/">President’s Commission on the History of Race and Racism</a>, a group of 20 faculty, deans, trustees, and senior administrators tasked with interrogating Columbia’s symbols and representations within a racial, historical context. While the commission is only in the preliminary stages of work, it has begun to establish <a href="https://columbiaandslavery.columbia.edu/historical-markers.html">historical markers</a> at residence halls honoring the buildings’ histories.

  As Bollinger passes the torch to Shafik, he will pass on an issue that is of particular importance to him: <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/02/28/with-affirmative-action-at-risk-bollingers-new-book-offers-sharp-defense/">affirmative action</a>. When Bollinger first stepped into the presidency, he was in the midst of leading a Supreme Court case from his time as University of Michigan president. <i>Grutter v. Bollinger, </i>argued in April 2003 and decided in June 2003, ultimately set a precedent for allowing race conscious college admissions.

  Although he will not serve as University president after June 30, Bollinger will still be watching.

  “It’s my University, too,” Bollinger said, as he prepares to transition into a solely professorial role next year.

  He hopes to continue teaching law students and writing more books. He will not offer his popular undergraduate course Freedom of Speech and Press next fall, according to the course catalog, although he said he has “adored teaching undergraduates.” Bollinger—or PrezBo, as he is known to students—said he likes his nickname, as it has “made me feel young.”

  “I love Columbia,” Bollinger said. “I just feel this sense of identification with it. It’s been the privilege of my life to be in this position.”
